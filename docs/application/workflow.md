# Workflows

A workflow is a set of tasks that are executed in a specific order. The tasks can be executed in parallel or sequentially. Workflows can be used to automate the deployment of applications. For example, deploying a web application requires deploying multiple services in a specific order. You can create a workflow to automate the deployment of the web application.

## View Workflow List
1. Click `Application Management` -> `Workflows` on the left navigation bar.
2. The workflow list under this project can be viewed on the workflow list page.
3. Use the search bar on the workflow list page to quickly search for related workflows.

## Create Workflow
1. Access the list page by viewing the workflow list.
2. Click `New Workflow`, enter the `name` to identify your workflow. Ensure the workflow name is unique for easy identification in the workflow list.

3. Add `Workflow Name` and `Workflow Description` of the workflow, specify the `Workflow Timeout` and `Workflow Parallelism` to limit the timeout and the number of tasks that can run simultaneously.
4. Add **Variables**. Click `New Variable`, enter the variable name and value, and configure the variable. Checking the `Runtime Configurable` checkbox to make variables could be reset if you want to change the variable value when the workflow is executed.

Variables can be referenced in the step configuration using `${workflow.var.variableName}`. It will be replaced with the variable value when the workflow is executed.
