# Services

## View Service List

Services belong to an environment and you can view the list of services in the environment view.

1. Click on `Application Management` in the left navigation bar.
2. Select a project through the drop-down button of the top-level breadcrumb.
3. In the environment tab of the project view, find the environment you need to operate on, and click on the environment name to enter the environment view.
4. In the services tab, you can view the list of services under this environment. You can switch to view services under different projects or environments through the top-level breadcrumb.

2. Find the service you need to view and click its name to enter the service details page.

## Create Service

1. Enter the services tab of the environment view.
2. Click `New Service`, select the template and version, enter the `Name`, `Description`, and `Tags`. The service name should be unique under the same environment.

## Edit Service

1. Enter the services tab of the environment view.
2. Find the service you need to edit, click `Edit`.
3. Modify the configuration as needed, then click the `Save` button. The service will be deployed once after editing.

## Service Dependency

Services can depend on each other by defining service output references. The referenced service will be deployed or deleted in bulk before the dependent service.

For example, if the web service depends on the MySQL service, the web service can reference the MySQL service. In the built-in web service template, you can reference the service in environment variables configuration by `${service.Service Name.Service Output Name}`. The web service can get the address and port information of the MySQL service from environment variables, thereby enabling communication between services.

## Service Orchestration

Service orchestration is a way to deploy multiple services together. Through orchestration, service dependencies can be implemented. In the orchestration, service dependencies and service deployment order can be defined. Depending on service dependency definitions, Seal will automatically deploy services in the order of dependencies. For example, when cloning or deleting multiple services in bulk, Seal will automatically create or delete services according to the order of orchestration.

## Rollback Service

1. Enter the services tab of the environment view.
2. Find the service you need to rollback.
3. Click on the operation drop-down button, select `Rollback`.
