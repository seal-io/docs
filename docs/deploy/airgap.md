# Airgap Installation

Suitable for offline installation scenarios.

> Prerequisites:
> - Provide an intranet container registry, e.g. Harbor;
> - Provide an intranet Git-based code repository, e.g. GitLab;
> - Allow access from the Walrus server to the container registry and the code repository.

## Preparing offline images
Retrieve the `walrus-images.txt`, `walrus-save-images.sh` and `walrus-load-images.sh` files from [Walrus Releases](https://github.com/seal-io/walrus/releases) for downloading offline images and pushing them to the container registry.

1. Use `walrus-save-images.sh` to download offline images on a Docker host with internet access:
```shell
sh walrus-save-images.sh --image-list walrus-images.txt
```

2. Upload the saved offline image package `walrus-images.tar.gz` and `walrus-load-images.sh` to a Docker host that has access to the container registry. Use `walrus-load-images.sh` to upload the offline images. Taking Harbor as an example for the container registry (if not, ensure to create a `sealio` project in the container registry beforehand).
```shell
docker login registry.example.com --username admin --password Harbor12345
sh walrus-load-images.sh --registry registry.example.com --harbor-user admin --harbor-password Harbor12345
```

## Preparing offline catalog
Fork or import all repositories from the [Builtin catalog](https://github.com/walrus-catalog) into the code repository.

You can refer to the following script to clone all repositories from `walrus-catalog` in batches and upload them to the code repository. Each repository needs to correspond to a specific internal repository, such as a GitLab Project.
```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Walrus catalog org
ORG_NAME="walrus-catalog"

# Get all repos in the Walrus catalog org
REPOS=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/orgs/$ORG_NAME/repos" | jq -r '.[].name')

for REPO_NAME in $REPOS; do
  # Clone repo
  git clone "https://github.com/$ORG_NAME/$REPO_NAME"
done

echo "All done!"
```

## Install Walrus
### Standalone Installation

Update the image in [Standalone Installation](../deploy/standalone.md) according to the intranet contianer registry. Additionally, add the environment variables `SERVER_SETTING_IMAGE_REGISTRY` and `SERVER_SETTING_DEPLOYER_IMAGE`, pointing to the intranet container registry and the offline Deployer image.

```shell
sudo docker run -d --privileged --restart=always --name walrus \
  -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  -e SERVER_SETTING_IMAGE_REGISTRY='registry.example.com' \
  -e SERVER_SETTING_DEPLOYER_IMAGE='registry.example.com/sealio/terraform-deployer:v0.1.4-airgap'  \
  registry.example.com/sealio/walrus:v0.4.0
```

If your container registry is a private registry that requiring authentication to pull images, additional configuration is needed. The steps are as follows.

For Standalone Installation of Walrus, the built-in K3s is used as the underlying runtime environment. If there is a need to configure K3s to pull images from a private registry, you should mount the `registries.yaml` into the Walrus server.

1. On the host where the Walrus server will run, create the `registries.yaml`:
```shell
mkdir -p /etc/walrus/k3s
vim /etc/walrus/k3s/registries.yaml
```

Fill in the following YAML content, replacing it with your container registry, username and password. If the private registry uses an untrusted TLS certificate, use the `insecure_skip_verify` parameter to skip certificate verification. If not needed, simply remove it:

```yaml
mirrors:
  docker.io:
    endpoint:
      - "https://registry.example.com"
  registry.example.com:
    endpoint:
      - "https://registry.example.com"
configs:
  "registry.example.com":
    auth:
      username: xxxxxx # This is the registry username
      password: xxxxxx # This is the registry password
    tls:
      insecure_skip_verify: true
```

2. When running the Walrus, mount the `registries.yaml` into the Walrus server:
```shell
sudo docker run -d --privileged --restart=always --name walrus \
  -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  -e SERVER_SETTING_IMAGE_REGISTRY='registry.example.com' \
  -e SERVER_SETTING_DEPLOYER_IMAGE='registry.example.com/sealio/terraform-deployer:v0.1.4-airgap'  \
  -v /etc/walrus/k3s/registries.yaml:/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml \
  registry.example.com/sealio/walrus:v0.4.0
```

3. After the Walrus server is running, enter the Walrus container to verify if the private registry configuration is effective:
```shell
docker exec -it walrus bash
cat /var/lib/k3s/agent/etc/containerd/config.toml
```

For more details, refer to the official K3s documentation [K3s Private Registry Configuration](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry).

4. Access the Walrus UI, and after the initial login, navigate to `https://<WALRUS_URL>/v1/settings`. Validate whether the `ImageRegistry` and `DeployerImage` settings are effective.

### High Availability Installation

Update the image in [High Availability Installation](../deploy/replication.md) according to the intranet contianer registry. Additionally, add the `SERVER_SETTING_IMAGE_REGISTRY` and `SERVER_SETTING_DEPLOYER_IMAGE` environment variables to the Walrus deployment, pointing to the intranet container registry and the offline Deployer image.

```shell
vim walrus.yaml
```
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: walrus
  namespace: walrus-system
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: walrus-server
          image: sealio/walrus:v0.4.0
          ...
          env:
            - name: SERVER_SETTING_IMAGE_REGISTRY
              value: registry.example.com
            - name: SERVER_SETTING_DEPLOYER_IMAGE
              value: registry.example.com/sealio/terraform-deployer:v0.1.4-airgap
...
```
```shell
kubectl apply -f walrus.yaml
```

If your container registry is a private registry that requiring authentication to pull images, additional configuration is needed. The steps are as follows.

1. To pull images from a private registry, Kubernetes requires credentials. First, create a credential secret:
```shell
kubectl create secret docker-registry registry-credential \
  --docker-server=<your-container-registry> \
  --docker-username=<your-name> \
  --docker-password=<your-password> \
  --docker-email=<your-email>
```

2. Modify the YAML in [High Availability Installation](../deploy/replication.md), add the `imagePullSecrets` to several Deploymentsï¼Œand then deploy Walrus following the steps for High Availability Installation. This ensures that kubelet can pull images from the private registry when creating Pods.
```shell
vim walrus.yaml
```
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
      ... 
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: registry-credential
...
```
```shell
kubectl apply -f walrus.yaml
```

4. Access the Walrus UI, and after the initial login, navigate to `https://<WALRUS_URL>/v1/settings`. Validate whether the `ImageRegistry` and `DeployerImage` settings are effective.

## Using intranet catalog
1. Disable the built-in catalog:

Navigate to `System Settings` -> `Server Management`, edit `Template Catalog Settings`, disable `Use built-in catalog` and save.

2. If the intranet catalog uses an untrusted TLS certificate, you can disable Walrus's certificate verification for catalogs (optional):

Navigate to `System Settings` -> `Server Management`, edit `Certificate Settings`, enable `Skip certificate authentication` and save.

3. Remove the built-in catalog and add the intranet catalog:

Navigate to `Operation Hub` -> `Catalogs`, check the `builtin` catalog, and choose to delete it.

And then choose `Add Catalog`, enter the catalog's name, description, source and choose type. For the source address, provide the complete git organization/group URL of the intranet catalog, such as https://github.com/walrus-catalog. Confirm and save.

Confirm that the intranet catalog is refreshing correctly. Navigate to `Operation Hub` -> `Templates` and verify that the templates load successfully.

> Note:
> - OpenAI-related features (AI Draft Template) are not available in offline environments.
> - If custom connectors are required, i.e., custom Terraform Providers, it's necessary to configure the mirror for the custom provider. Refer to `https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/providers/mirror` for guidance.
