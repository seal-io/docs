# Overview

Seal is an application management software that helps users achieve application configuration management, infrastructure orchestration, environment management and cost management (FinOps), providing momentum for platform engineering.

Seal's application management has the following features:

### Separation of Concerns

Platform and operations engineers bundle infrastructure capabilities into service templates, manage environments and integrations with external systems, while application developers manage applications by following the golden paths, shielding and reducing the complexity of the infrastructure, achieving separation of concerns.

### Platform and Runtime Independence

It provides diversified application runtime support, including cloud-native and traditional application deployment and management. The underlying platform is independent, supporting any Kubernetes cluster, public cloud or private cloud infrastructure, realizing multi-cloud, hybrid cloud unified deployment and management.

### Flexible Application and Configuration Management

Based on the service template, it provides flexible application definition capabilities at the upper layer, while supporting dynamic configuration overwriting and management capabilities in different environments, reducing the burden of application deployment and management.

### Rich Open Source Ecosystem and Extensibility

Built on Terraform, and is able to reuse the rich capabilities in the Terraform open source ecosystem to support various resources, while having powerful extensibility, flexibly meeting the different needs of enterprises.
