# Improvement Plan

## What is the Improvement Plan?

The Improvement Plan collects aggregate information about the installation of Walrus and which features are used. This information is used by seal.io to help make the product better and is not shared with third parties.

## What information is collected?？

No specific personal information will be collected, such as usernames, passwords, resource names, or addresses.

The primary data collected includes:

- General Information: Randomly generated UUID for Walrus installation, version, CPU architecture and aggregate count of users.
- Application Deployment Features: Aggregate counts of projects, environments, resources and connectors.

## How can I participate in or opt out of the Improvement Plan?

After the initial setup, administrators can go to the `System` page in the `Server` section of the UI, and edit the `Basic` to participate in or opt out of the Improvement Plan.
